### Make "Suggested Edits" reviews wider
..and choices for 10 other nice things:

- Remove the "Big Box" on the right 1/3 of the screen.
- Replace the radios with real buttons, like they used to be.
- Rework the title to not repeat information.
- Move the post type (Question / Answer / Tag Wiki) to the title bar.
- Move the post-diff choices (Inline/Side-by-side/Side-by-side Markdown) up next to the Filter-button.
- Move the daily review progress to the "Review task"-button
- Add back the user cards of both the author and previous editor.
- Get the statistics of the editor.
- Change the size and colour of the edit "comment", which is renamed to "summary".
- Make notifications more prominent.
- Remove the line trough on deleted content.
